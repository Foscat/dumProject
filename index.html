                       Meals must generally be prepared on the ground before takeoff. 
                       Guillaume de Syon, a history professor at Albright College who 
                       wrote about the history of airline meals, said that the 
                       higher altitudes alter the taste of the food and the function 
                       of the taste buds; according to de Syon the food may taste "dry 
                       and flavorless" as a result of the pressurization and passengers, 
                       feeling thirsty due to pressurization, may drink alcohol when they 
                       ought to drink water. Tests have shown that the perception of 
                       saltiness and sweetness drops 30% at high altitudes. The low humidity 
                       in airline cabins also dries out the nose which decreases olfactory 
                       sensors which are essential for tasting flavor in dishes
                    </p>

                        Food safety is paramount in the airline catering industry. A case of 
                        mass food poisoning amongst the passengers on an airliner could have 
                        disastrous consequences. For example, on February 20, 1992, shrimp 
                        tainted with cholera was served on Aerolíneas Argentinas Flight 386. 
                        An elderly passenger died and other passengers fell ill. For this 
                        reason catering firms and airlines have worked together to provide 
                        a set of industry guidelines specific to the needs of airline catering. 
                        The World Food Safety Guidelines for Airline Catering is offered free of 
                        charge by the International Flight Service Association.

                       Let's face it, English is a crazy language.  There is no egg in eggplant, 
                       \nor ham in hamburger; neither apples nor pine are in pineapple. English 
                       muffins aren't English, nor are French fries French.  Sweetmeats are candies, 
                       while sweetbreads—which aren't sweet—are meat.  We take English for granted, 
                       but if we explore some of its paradoxes, we find that quicksand is slow, boxing 
                       rings are square, and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor a pig!

                        If the plural of tooth is teeth, shouldn't the plural of booth be beeth? 
                        One goose, two geese.  So—one moose, two meese?  One mouse, two mice, 
                        means one house, two hice?  And one index, two indices?  If you have more 
                        than one ibex, why don't you have ibices?  Doesn't it seem crazy that you 
                        can make amends but you can't make just a single amend?  If you throw out 
                        some odds and ends, but keep one item, is it an odd or an end?  Which one 
                        is right to have left?
